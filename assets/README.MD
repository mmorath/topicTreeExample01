# Assets Directory

This `assets` directory is a resource hub for the project. It contains visual and design-related files that support documentation, presentation, and development work. Here's a breakdown of its structure and contents:

## Directory Structure

- `/screenshots`: Contains screen captures demonstrating the features and usage of the project.
- Other directories can be added here to organize different types of assets such as diagrams, logos, etc.

## Purpose

The files within this directory are used throughout the project's documentation, particularly the `README.md` at the root of the repository. They serve to enhance understanding, provide visual references, and improve the overall readability of the documentation.

## Contribution Guidelines

- When adding new screenshots, please ensure they are optimized for web viewing (compressed appropriately without significant loss of clarity).
- Name the files descriptively, so their content or purpose can be understood without needing to view them.
- Update this `README.md` if new types of assets are introduced or if the organization of the directory changes.

## Usage

To reference these assets in the project documentation, use relative paths like so:

```markdown
![Descriptive Alt Text](./screenshots/filename.png)
